This is wm2jsPlus. It creates a /dev/input/js? device through uinput.

This is only a simple hack over the original wm2js which can be found on
https://trac.v2.nl/browser/andres/wm2js/

It enables you to use your wiimote (new models, ending in -TR) and classic
gamepad on your linux box as a normal joystick.

As long as I don't own an old wiimote nor a nunchuk I don't know if
any of these work, but I'm pretty sure nunchuk will not. You can use
the original wm2js instead.

Please take into account that the bluetooth address of the wiimote is
hardcoded in wm2jsPlus.c. I know it's dirty, but I'm lazy. Maybe you
can clean it a little.
